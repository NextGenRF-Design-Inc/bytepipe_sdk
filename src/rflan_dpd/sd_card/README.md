# Creating a DPD Demo Boot Disk
To run the DPD Demo, start by downloading the micro-SD card .zip file located [HERE](./) or from the [Releases](https://github.com/NextGenRF-Design-Inc/bytepipe_sdk/releases) page under "Latest" and save it to your laptop or PC.  Be sure to use the version matching your specific SOM architecture (either rflan_dpd_xczu3cg_sdcard.zip or rflan_dpd_xczu2cg_sdcard.zip).

Insert your micro-SD card into your laptop or PC, using an adapter if necessary, and delete or archive any files on the card.  Extract the contents of the .zip file to a temporary location and then copy them to the root folder micro-SD card.

If completed properly, the micro-SD card should now contain the following files:
* adrv9001_setup.txt
* BOOT.BIN
* CFR_sample_rate_15p36M_bw_10M_DPD_Demo.csv
* rflan_setup.txt
* tx_dpd_disabled.txt
* tx_dpd_enabled.txt
